Raytracer in Excel


ReadMe

This excel file allows you to gain an intuitive understanding of how raytracing works in the basic setting of an excel workbook.
The approach underpinning this model is largely based on that used in the book "The Ray Tracer Challenge" by Jamis Buck. It is an excelllent book that teaches the foundations of Raytracing in a fun and engaging way.

However, this model only implements a select number of concepts from the book, as oddly not everything is portable to our favourite application!
I hope this is of help for those trying to learn the basics of raytracing!


Instructions:

First, you need to go to the sheet named "Screen". Next, you need to run the macro called "Play" - you can do this using the "PLAY" button.

This macro assigns new functionality to the following keys:
 - "w", "a", "s", "d": press these to move the camera forwards, backwards, and sideways
 - "r", "f": press these to move the camera up and down
 - "u", "i", "o", "j", "k", "l": press these to rotate the camera along the 3 different 3d axes
 - "esc": press this to end the game and reset all key functionality

NOTE: this macro overrides these key's normal functionality - you must press ESC at the end of your session to reenble these keys in excel to their original functionality

Alternatively, you can press the "ANIMATE" button which will move the camera along a predetermined path.
